#### Description
A requirement of this project was to create this game within the [world of Ethshar](http://www.ethshar.com/), created by Lawrence Watt-Evans. 
The player takes on the role of Kilisha of Eastgate, apprentice to the wizard Ithanalin the Wise. A spell gone awry has caused Ithanalin the Wise to split his soul into pieces, which are materialized in different household goods. Kilisha is left with the task of restoring her master by matching three or more spells (in-game elements, akin to jewels in Bejeweled) to extract his soul-pieces from the household items.

#### Rules
- The player must match at least three of the same spells at once, otherwise, the spells will not move. (When a match is made, this will be referred to as a spell being cast.)
- The player must reach a certain score to complete a level and obtain a soul-piece.
- The player must complete the level within the time limit to obtain a soul-piece.

#### Mechanics
When a spell is selected, the player moves that entire row or column with it, akin to a _Rubik’s Cube_. Spells do damage to the household items based on how many spells are matched and if there was a chain reaction of more than one spell being cast at once. Each item will have a timer and a point goal. The harder difficulty levels will have a lower timer and slightly higher point goal, to make it hard for the player to complete them and receive all the soul-pieces.

#### Win Condition
Each level, the player faces a different household good that's possessed by Ithanlin’s soul. The player must score a certain amount of points each round within the specified time limit to be win and gain the soul-piece from that household good. Players must beat all of the levels in order to fully restore Ithanalin and beat the game.

#### Objectives to Winning
Once a round has started, a timer will begin. If a player has not reached the required amount of points before the timer runs out, the player will lose and will have to play the level again to get that level’s soul-piece.
